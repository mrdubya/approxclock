Approximate Clock
-----------------

Approximate Clock reports the time approximately in words.
For example if the current time is 2:47pm then it will report the time as::

    $ approxclock
    Quarter to Three.

Top of the hour is told as ``5 o'clock``, and times around midday and midnight
as ``Ten to Midnight`` and ``Quarter past Midday``.

This is a very long time work in progress project.
The aim is to make configurable module and script that can vary various aspects
of the clock, such as running fast (in case you tend to be late to appointments)
or whether you prefer Noon to Midday.
